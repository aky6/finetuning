{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you feel the company supports mental health openly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the intent is there, we have EAPs and wellness days, but the culture still glorifies overworking. If leadership took a stand on balance, it’d normalize using those benefits."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Was your manager well-prepared for the review?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seemed like they rushed through it. I doubt they had gone through my work in detail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do you feel about working at this company overall?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Overall, I feel good working here. The culture is relatively positive, and there’s a sense of freedom in how I manage my time. I enjoy working with my team, people are respectful and collaborative. That said, there are times when communication feels rushed or incomplete, especially when changes are made. Still, I appreciate the growth I’ve had here so far."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the few things you enjoy about working here?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "First, I genuinely like the people, they’re helpful and sharp. Second, the projects are interesting and often push me to learn new things. And third, the flexibility around work hours has been a huge plus, especially when juggling personal responsibilities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Would you recommend this company to others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, but with caveats. It’s a good place to start your career or learn fast, but it may not be ideal for long-term growth unless you're in a high-visibility team."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you think leaders are trained to handle sensitive issues well?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some are, but not all. I’ve seen managers ignore mental health comments or uncomfortable interactions because they don’t know how to handle them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How was your recent performance review experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was brief and vague. I was hoping for more specific feedback and a development plan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you feel supported in your role by your manager?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, my manager has my back when it counts. They’re willing to step in when things escalate and always try to unblock me."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you feel your career goals are understood by your manager?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We’ve discussed it once, but I don’t think there's a concrete plan yet. I'd appreciate regular check-ins."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Did you get feedback you can act on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A little. It was mostly generic, “good job,” “keep it up” - but nothing concrete to work on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What suggestions do you have for improving workplace wellness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Train managers to spot burnout. Also, make wellness discussions part of monthly check-ins, not just something we do during crises."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you feel your manager fosters your professional growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s one area where we could do better. I’ve had to initiate all conversations around growth and learning. I’d appreciate it if they were more proactive in identifying opportunities for me."}]}
