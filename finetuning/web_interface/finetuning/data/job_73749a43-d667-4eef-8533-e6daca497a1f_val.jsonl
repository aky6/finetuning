{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What aspects of your work do you find frustrating?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sometimes, decision-making is too top-down. Also, it feels like we're always in a rush, there’s no breathing room to reflect or course correct. It leads to errors and burnout."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you feel confident giving feedback on company policies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I’ve given feedback through surveys, but I’m not sure if it went anywhere. It’d be great to hear back about what changed based on employee input."}]}
