If leadership took a stand on balance, it’d normalize using those benefits."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Has the grievance redressal mechanism worked for you or anyone you know?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A former teammate filed a complaint and the resolution took a very long time. While the intent seemed there, the pace and communication from HR were not reassuring."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you think current policies reflect the needs of employees?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not entirely. For example, the policy on reimbursements is outdated. It assumes paper receipts and physical forms when everything else is digital now."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How frequently do you receive feedback from your manager?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe once a month during check-ins, but I wish it was more regular and impromptu, even informal and quick conversation can help course correct before a project ends."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What aspects of your work do you find frustrating?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sometimes, decision-making is too top-down.
