{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How frequently do you receive feedback from your manager?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe once a month during check-ins, but I wish it was more regular and impromptu, even informal and quick conversation can help course correct before a project ends."}]}

She brushed it off publicly, but I could tell it made her uncomfortable. I’m not sure if it was escalated formally, but I do think the manager should’ve intervened."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Was your manager well-prepared for the review?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seemed like they rushed through it. I doubt they had gone through my work in detail."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How are you coping with work-related stress?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I’ve developed my own coping mechanisms, like setting strict boundaries after hours and taking short walks during the day.
