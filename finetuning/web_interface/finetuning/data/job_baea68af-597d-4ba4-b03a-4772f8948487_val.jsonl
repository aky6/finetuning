{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What made you decide to leave the organization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was a mix of limited growth opportunities and feeling stagnant. I voiced my interest in trying new roles but didn’t get much support. Eventually, I realized I needed a change."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Have you used any mental health resources the company provides?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not yet. I didn’t know exactly how to access them or what they cover. Maybe an internal awareness campaign would help."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Would you recommend this company to others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, but with caveats. It’s a good place to start your career or learn fast, but it may not be ideal for long-term growth unless you're in a high-visibility team."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you feel your opinions are valued at work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In team discussions, yes, I feel heard. But when it comes to policy-level decisions, it sometimes feels like feedback is collected but not acted upon."}]}

I understand the larger goals, but I don’t always see how my individual tasks tie back into that. A more regular business update or team strategy sync might help with that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you feel the performance review process is fair?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not always. It feels like a checkbox exercise, and ratings don’t always reflect actual contributions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What did you enjoy the most during your time here?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The people. I’ve built friendships and learned so much from my peers. Also, the sense of purpose in some projects was deeply fulfilling."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How well are policy updates communicated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They’re usually sent over email, but often without any real explanation of the “why” behind the change. People read them and move on without fully understanding."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do policies impact your day-to-day work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Policies shape everything — from how I apply for leave to what benefits I can use. When they’re unclear or inconsistently applied, it slows me down."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do you feel comfortable discussing mental health with peers or supervisors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With peers and friends - yes. With my supervisor, not really. There’s a silent expectation to just “deal with it” and not let personal issues interfere with work."}]}
