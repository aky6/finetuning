{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How would you describe your team dynamics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our team dynamics are generally healthy. We communicate openly, and everyone pulls their weight. Sometimes, however, deadlines bring stress and people get short-tempered, but we usually resolve things quickly."}]}
